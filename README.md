# Run from Docker

**This is for deploying the app (HCL).**

Running this app inside a Docker container is very easy.
You need to have a Ubuntu/Linux computer with Docker installed.

Docker will automatically download the image and run the app from just one (but very long) command:

```
sudo docker run \
--env=RDS_HOSTNAME=xxx \
--env=RDS_PORT=xxx \
--env=RDS_DATABASE=xxx \
--env=RDS_USERNAME=xxx \
--env=RDS_PASSWORD=xxx \
--env=MDB_ADDRESS=xxx \
--env=MDB_PORT=xxx \
--env=MDB_DATABASE=xxx \
--env=MDB_USERNAME=xxx \
--env=MDB_PASSWORD=xxx \
--env=BOND_HOSTNAME=xxx \
--env=SENDGRID_API_USER=xxx \
--env=SENDGRID_API_KEY=xxx \
--dns=80.80.12.242 \
--publish=xxx:8000 \
-d bmdako/userdb
```

All the `-e` parameters are the environent variables to allow the app to connect to dependent services eg. SendGrid. These will be supplied seperatly
The `-p` parameter determines what port the container will bind the app to.

Visit **http://\<Server DNS/IP\>:\<Port\>** to make sure the app is running. The *Port* is the one you have defined above.

# Build the Docker image

**This is for creating a new release (DevOp / Release Manager).**

First, check out the lastest source code from the GitHub repo.

Next, to create a build locally run:

```
sudo docker build -t bmdako/userdb .
``` 

(The source code and the Node modules will be copied onto the Docker image.)

Lastly, to upload the newly built version of the image to Docker Hub, run:

```
sudo docker push bmdako/userdb
```

(You need the right credentials on the Docker Hub to push the image.)


# Run from source

**This is for developing new feature and bug fixing. (Developer).**

If you like to run the app directly from source, you can either clone this repo or download the latest ZIP.

You need Node (incl. NPM) and Python (for PostgreSQL client) installed.

First, install the depencdencies by running: 

```
npm install
```

Before you can start the app, the following environment variables need to be set:

- RDS_HOSTNAME
- RDS_PORT
- RDS_DATABASE
- RDS_USERNAME
- RDS_PASSWORD
- MDB_ADDRESS
- MDB_PORT
- MDB_DATABASE
- MDB_USERNAME
- MDB_PASSWORD
- BOND_HOSTNAME
- SENDGRID_API_USER
- SENDGRID_API_KEY

Set these using a Bash-script eg.:

```
#!/bin/bash

export RDS_HOSTMAME=xxx
export RDS_PORT=xxx
and so on and so on and so on
```

Now, start the app with the following command:

```
node src/app.js
```

'Or, if you have installed *gulp* (using `npm install -g gulp`), just with the command `gulp`.

Visit [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) if you get no error after startup.
